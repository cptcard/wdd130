            <p>Hi there. My name is Grant Nettles and I am enjoying my third semester here on campus. However, this is not my first rodeo. I have four other brothers and a beautiful fiance. I can't wait to graduate and become a productive meber of society. I already have three other degrees one in business managment, and two other in liberal arts. I am hoping to learn so much this semester from this class and two other programing classes. There is much to learn so I should get back to work.</p>

                <p>California is a western coast state. Filled with natural beauties and a variety of landscapes. It is bordered by Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona. It also sits on the vast Pacific Ocean. I lived and mostly in one of the southern most desert of California the Mojave.</p>
