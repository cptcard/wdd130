            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>This site's purpose is to build revenue and share information about potential rafting trips. For example, to enjoy a hot summer one can find themselves in the need of some adventure and some refreshing water. Jump into the river with our trained rafting crew and enjoy a summer full of fun. With our planning site, we can find not only the route you want to take but keep you in contact with our guides that can get you along your thrilling journey. What are you waiting for? Hop on in with us.</p>
        
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>Our target audience is mostly middle to young age persons, including families with a variety of ages and people. People come to a rafting site to feel adventurous without all the danger of solo water expeditions. This means we should focus on safety and showing how the guides can handle a little bit of water. The questions they will ask will include where are we going? What risk is involved? Is my healthiness a concern? Is my age a problem? What is provided? Who is our guide? What equipment will we use? What classes of rapids are we handling? What is the plan with each route? Most of the needs are food, safety, and peace of mind. They can get this at our site through maps, videos, images, and documentation. They should be able to access the site through phone, desktop, or laptop.</p>
